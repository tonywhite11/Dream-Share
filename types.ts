// Currently, no global types are specific to this simple application
// that are not already handled by component props or service responses.
// This file is here for scalability.

// Example:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
